Description:
	M5PrimeLab is a Matlab/Octave toolbox for building regression trees
	and model trees using M5' method as well as building ensembles of
	M5' trees using Bagging, Random Forests, and Extremely Randomized
	Trees. The built trees can also be linearized into decision rules
	either directly or using the M5'Rules method. M5PrimeLab accepts
	input variables to be continuous, binary, and categorical, as well
	as manages missing values.
	The source code is tested under Matlab version 8.6 (R2015b) and
	Octave version 4.0.0.

Installation (for Matlab):
	Start Matlab and select "Set path..." from the File menu. Click
	"Add with subfolders" button and select the M5PrimeLab folder in the
	file dialog. Press the Save button in order to save your changes
	to the Matlab search path. The toolbox is now installed. Have fun.
